Therefore, I should try a different approach to get the top two people with the highest approval ratings on the eve of the 2020 US election.\n\nInstead of using the \"getpeoplebytopic_for_election2020_smartable\" function, I can try using the \"osay_for_us_presidential_election\" function from the \"us_presidential_election\" tool to retrieve the results for a specific state. This function returns the JSON block of results for one state, one year. I can choose two states that are likely to have high approval ratings for the candidates.\n\nThought:\n1. Use the \"osay_for_us_presidential_election\" function to get the results for two states with high approval ratings.\n2. Extract the names of the two parties from the results.\n3.

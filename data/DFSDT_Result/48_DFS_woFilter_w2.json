Remember:\n1.ALWAYS call \"Finish\" function at the end of the task. And the final answer should contain enough information to show to the user,If you can't handle the task, or you find that function calls always fail(the function is not valid now), use function Finish->give_up_and_restart.\n2.Do not use origin tool names, use only subfunctions' names.\nYou have access of the following tools:\n1.nutrition_by_api_ninjas: Natural language API to extract nutrition data from any text. See more info at https://api-ninjas.com/api/nutrition.\n2.food_nutrition_information: search and find foods with their nutritional information\n3.fitness_calculator: Find \"body fat percentage\",  \"ideal weight\", \"BMI\", \"daily calory requirement\" and some macro nutrients with this api.\n4.test1: Test1AA\n"

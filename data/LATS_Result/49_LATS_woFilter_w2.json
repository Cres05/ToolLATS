      "Sure! I'll provide you with three classical decision tree algorithms and their pseudocode. The three classical algorithms are:\n\n1. **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)**\n2. **C4.5**\n3. **CART (Classification and Regression Tree)**\n\n### 1. ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)\n**Pseudocode:**\n```\nfunction ID3(dataset, attributes, target_attribute):\n    # Create a root node for the tree\n    root = Node()\n\n    # If all examples are positive, return a single node tree with label = positive\n    if all examples are positive in dataset:\n        root.label = 'positive'\n        return root\n\n    # If all examples are negative, return a single node tree with label = negative\n    if all examples are negative in dataset:\n        root.label = 'negative'\n        return root\n\n    # If attributes is empty, return a single node tree with label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n    if attributes is empty:\n        root.label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n        return root\n\n    # Otherwise, begin the process of splitting\n    best_attribute = attribute that best classifies examples (using Information Gain)\n    root.attribute = best_attribute\n\n    # For each possible value of best_attribute\n    for each value in best_attribute:\n        subset = dataset where best_attribute == value\n        if subset is empty:\n            child = Node()\n            child.label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n            root.add_child(value, child)\n        else:\n            child = ID3(subset, attributes - best_attribute, target_attribute)\n            root.add_child(value, child)\n\n    return root\n```\n\n### 2. C4.5\n**Pseudocode:**\n```\nfunction C4.5(dataset, attributes, target_attribute):\n    # Create a root node for the tree\n    root = Node()\n\n    # If all examples are positive, return a single node tree with label = positive\n    if all examples are positive in dataset:\n        root.label = 'positive'\n        return root\n\n    # If all examples are negative, return a single node tree with label = negative\n    if all examples are negative in dataset:\n        root.label = 'negative'\n        return root\n\n    # If attributes is empty, return a single node tree with label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n    if attributes is empty:\n        root.label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n        return root\n\n    # Otherwise, begin the process of splitting\n    best_attribute = attribute that best classifies examples (using Gain Ratio)\n    root.attribute = best_attribute\n\n    # For each possible value of best_attribute\n    for each value in best_attribute:\n        subset = dataset where best_attribute == value\n        if subset is empty:\n            child = Node()\n            child.label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n            root.add_child(value, child)\n        else:\n            child = C4.5(subset, attributes - best_attribute, target_attribute)\n            root.add_child(value, child)\n\n    return root\n```\n\n### 3. CART (Classification and Regression Tree)\n**Pseudocode:**\n```\nfunction CART(dataset, target_attribute, type):\n    # Create a root node for the tree\n    root = Node()\n\n    # If all examples have the same label, return a single node tree with that label\n    if all examples have the same label in dataset:\n        root.label = label of examples\n        return root\n\n    # If dataset is empty, return a single node tree with label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n    if dataset is empty:\n        root.label = most common value of target attribute in dataset\n        return root\n\n    # Otherwise, begin the process of splitting\n    best_split = find the best split for the dataset (using Gini Index for classification or MSE for regression)\n    root.split = best_split\n\n    # Split the dataset\n    left_subset, right_subset = split dataset based on best_split\n\n    # Recursively build the tree\n    root.left = CART(left_subset, target_attribute, type)\n    root.right = CART(right_subset, target_attribute, type)\n\n    return root\n```\n\nThese pseudocodes provide a high-level overview of how each decision tree algorithm works. Each algorithm has its unique way of selecting the best attribute or split to create a decision tree."
